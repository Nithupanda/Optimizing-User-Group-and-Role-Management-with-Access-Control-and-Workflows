Optimizing User, Group, and Role Management with Access Control and Workflows


Problem Statement:
In a small project management team consisting of a Project Manager (Alice) and a Team Member (Bob), there is a need to efficiently manage project tasks and ensure accountability throughout the project lifecycle. The current system lacks clear role definitions, access controls, and a structured workflow, leading to confusion regarding task assignments and progress tracking.
Objective:
1.Define User Roles Clearly: Establish distinct roles for Alice (Project Manager) and Bob (Team Member) to ensure clarity in responsibilities and access rights within the project management tool.
2.Implement Access Control Mechanisms: Create a system that restricts Bobâ€™s access to project creation and editing features while allowing him to view and update his assigned tasks, thereby preventing unauthorized changes.
3.Streamline Workflow Processes: Develop a structured workflow for task assignment and progress tracking, ensuring that Alice can easily assign tasks to Bob and monitor their completion in a timely manner.
